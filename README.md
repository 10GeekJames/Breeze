# Breeze.js

Breeze is a data management library for JavaScript that makes it easy to query data from the server. Breezeâ€™s simple, yet powerful API allows you to make complex queries against the server, cache the data on the client for performance, and supports offline scenarios.

When used with a databinding framework like Knockout, Breeze enables you to code in a familiar architectural pattern like MVC or MVVM and keep your view separate from your business logic.

## Official releases

The Breeze source is free, open-source, and available here on GitHub. If you don't need the full source code, you can download one of the official releases.
