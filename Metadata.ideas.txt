Changes to Metadata api to support "custom" metadata.

1) MetadataStore.importMetadata supports "custom" nodes at the entity and property levels. 
	1) native format with "custom" nodes embedded in full metadata doc. ( this is what exported metadata with custom nodes will look like)
	2) native format with standalone "custom" nodes keyed by either entityType or property name. 
2) MetadataStore.addEntityType supports "custom" nodes (entity and property level).
3) EntityType.setProperties will now accept a "custom" node.
4) Either
     1) DataProperty and NavigationProperty will support a setProperties method that will allow a "custom" node.
	        or
	 2) EntityType.addCustom(custom, [ property])
